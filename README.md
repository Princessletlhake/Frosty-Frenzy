# Project: # Frosty-Frenzy 📄

## An ice-cream landing page.

## 📌 About the Project

This project guides you through building a static landing page **from scratch**, using HTML and CSS (Flexbox). You'll follow a provided design mockup and replicate its layout—without worrying about pixel-perfect accuracy or mobile responsiveness yet.

You are encouraged to:

- Use content and images of your own choosing.
- Substitute placeholder text with real content if you like.
- Credit free image creators in this README.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. Break the layout into four main content sections plus a footer.
2. Build the HTML structure first, then style using CSS.
3. Apply Flexbox skills learned in the foundations curriculum from The Odin Project.
4. Use meaningful commit messages and push your repository regularly.
